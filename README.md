# GNN For Text Classification
 Applications which involve text classification may still need a breakthrough in capturing the latent structure in the text and more complex dependencies which limits its capacity to make correct predictions. This paper presents a new approach to a text classification application in which a hybrid graph representation learning algorithm has been used to demonstrate interactions between latent semantic and structural data in text documents. Text is represented as a graph, where a node represents a sentence and an edge represents the semantic relationship between two nodes. With nodes converted to embed- dings generated through Sentence-BERT, it offers contextualized representations for every node. Along with this framework, we also learn low-dimensional representations of the text graphs using Graph Auto Encoders. Our model thus enhances gen- eralization and has a powerful representation for downstream tasks by minimizing the difference between reconstructed and input graphs.Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses traditional methods by successfully integrating seman- tic and structural information to enhance classification accuracy. This work contributes to the advancement of GNN-based archi- tectures for text retrieval, demonstrating the potential of graphs in natural language processing.
